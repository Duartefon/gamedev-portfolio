            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p> This game was the final project for the course Modelation and Simulation of Natural Systems.
                Throughout the course I've learned many topics such as Physics Simulation, Particle Systems,
                Autonomous Agents, Cellular Automata and Fractals.
                The systems I ended up implementing into my game were: </p>

            <h2>Physics Simulation</h2>
            <h2>The Body</h2>
            <p> Before we can have physics in a game we need a way to represent our "things" or our "objects" like the
                player, enemy, etc, in the simulated physical world of our game.
                With that in mind I implemented a RigidBody that will represent all the entities that move in my game:
                the player, the enemy and even projectiles.
            </p>

                            <p>A rigid body means that it will not be possible to deform the body, in other words, the
                                distance between any points of a given body stays the same no matter what forces are
                                applied to it. However, the body can move throughout space when forces are applied to
                                it. In this game both friction and velocities are simulated by the rigidBody.
                                For this to be possible we need the following vectors: </p>
                            <ul class="custom-list">
                                <li>Position Vector with x and y coordinates to represent it's position in space</li>
                                <li>2d Velocity Vector</li>
                                <li>2d Acceleration Vector </li>
                                <li>A method to apply force to the body once</li>
                                <li>A method to simulate all forces applied to the body</li>

                    </section>
                    <p>Now that we have a way to represent our body in the virtual world we need a way to be able to,
                        move it move it, through it. In the next diagram you can see how the movement was planned out:

                    <h1> The RigidBody</h1>
                    <p> The RigidBody class has 3 types of movement that each children can use: </p>
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li> <strong>Position </strong> - case Position where the Vector Position is directly acessed
                            and altered, equivalent to teleportation</li>
                        <li> <strong> Velocity</strong> - generic case where the body has velocity and acceleration</li>
                        <li> <strong> Force </strong> - where each instance of a RigidBody can override the main way of
                            moving</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> The following code represents the types of movement mentioned in the class RigidBody:</p>

                    <pre><code class="language-java">       public void move(float dt, ControlType ct, PApplet p) {
            switch (ct) {
                    case POSITION:
                        break; //not useful for this game
                                
                    case VELOCITY:
                        vel.add(acc.mult(dt));
                        pos.add(PVector.mult(vel, dt));
                        // acc.mult(0);
                        break;
                
                    case FORCE:
                        force(dt, p); // each child (extends) of RididBody will have different ways of moving
                        break; // player is different from enemy for example
                    }
                }

        protected abstract void force(float dt, PApplet p); 
                
                        </code></pre>
                    <br>
                    <h1> Movement Implementation</h1>
                    <p> The classes that will extend rigidBody will either use the Velocity type of
                        movement, like particle systems, and classes like the player will override the force method to
                        implement its own way of moving. You can see this in the following code, that is the
                        implementation of the stock and flow diagram:</p>

                    <pre><code class="language-java">     protected void force(float dt, PApplet p) {
            PVector frictionForce = PVector.mult(vel, -frictionCoeff);
            displayVectors(p, d, frictionForce, 255, 255, 255);
        
            vel.add(frictionForce);
            pos.add(PVector.mult(vel, dt));
            vel.add(PVector.mult(acc, dt));
    
            PVector newForce = PVector.mult(desiredDir(), speed * accelerationBoost);
            displayVectors(p, d, getDesiredDir(), 0, 255, 0);
    
            // Apply logarithmic acceleration decay based on current speed
            float speedFactor = 1.5f - PApplet.map(vel.mag(), 0, maxSpeed, 0, 1);
            newForce.mult(speedFactor);
    
            displayVectors(p, d, vel, 0, 0, 255);
    
            applyForce(newForce);
    
            vel.limit(maxSpeed);
            protected abstract void force(float dt, PApplet p); 
            }    
                                        </code></pre>
                    <br><br>
                    <p> The inspiration for the movement was source based games where when you press a desired key,
                        you'll have your movement incrementally added up until you reach the desired direction, instead
                        of
                        being instantaneous. The current velocity keeps being added a new force until it reaches the new
                        direction vector, which is calculated depending on the input of the player:</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="center-img">
                        <img display="center" src=../images/mssn/mod/player_force.png>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <p> The enemy for example is an Autonomous Agent, and it's movement will be similar to the player,
                        however the way the wished direction vector is calculated depends on the behaviour that the
                        agent is using. In this game the boid uses 2 behaviours - wander and seek, which will be
                        explained in greater detail in the Boid section. The following is the force function of the boid
                        class:</p>
                    <br>
                    <pre><code class = "language-java">
            @Override
            public void force(float dt, PApplet p) {
                PVector vd = applyBehaviours(dt, p).copy(); // this line is different
                
                PVector frictionForce = PVector.mult(vel, -frictionCoeff);
                
                vel.add(frictionForce);
                pos.add(PVector.mult(vel, dt));
                vel.add(PVector.mult(vd, dt)); //here the paramater vd is different, in player it uses ac
            
                float speedFactor = 1.5f - PApplet.map(vel.mag(), 0, maxSpeed, 0, 1);
                PVector newForce = PVector.mult(vd, speed * accelerationBoost);
                newForce.mult(speedFactor);
            
                applyForce(newForce);
                vel.limit(maxSpeed);
            }
            
     </code></pre>

                    <p> In retrospective, the common functionaly in t   he force method, between the player and enemy
                        classes, could be
                        refactored into it's own method in the rigidBody class. Only the directional vector is
                        calculated differently and
                        could've been passed as a parameter, to reduce repeated code with the same functionality </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1> Bullet </h1>
                    <p> The Bullet class also implements it's own force method, since once it's been shot I wanted the
                        bullet to move in a straight line, keeping the direction at the moment it was shot. The
                        following
                        code implements this:

                    </p>

                pos.x += speed * dirx;
                pos.y += speed * diry;

                    <h1> Particle System</h1>
                    <p> The particle System has the same movement as the player but the particles, use the
                        Velocity movement case of the rigidBody. And with that all entities that use the class RigidBody
                        have

            <h2>The Boid</h2>
            Boids are a form of autonomous agents that can be though of as a small robot that will respond directly to
            any stimuli its sensors give it without processing it.
            A boid can have many behaviours and through this course I implemented many but in my game I only ended up
            using two: <strong> Seek</strong> and <strong>Wander</strong>

                        <li>DNA - defines the possible values for the boid like maxSpeed and maxForce</li>

            <h2>Particle System</h2>
            <p> In this game I used a particle system to simulate the exhaust coming from the ship. To achieve this,
                after implemeting the particle system itself, I added it to
                the end of the ship and made sure the way the exhaust moves is the same as the player. Therefore the
                exhaust will always keep its relative position to the ship, the same. It was also fun to learn that
                William T. Reeves of LucasFilm was the creator of the particle systems, with the iconic "Genesis Effect"
            </p>

                    <p>To understand a particle system it's important to understand the key differences between the
                        particles generated by the Particle System and the Particle System itself. A particle system is
                        something that has mass and can move through the virtual space and interact with this virtual
                        world. However the particles itself
                        don't have mass and don't interact with the world outside the system. Therefore the particles
                        live and die by the system. The following diagram is the uml of the particle system that was
                        implemented. To be noted that even tho it's not in the uml, the particle system class extends
                        the class rigidBody</p>

            <h2>Cellular Automata</h2>
            <p> In a future where this game development was finished, this game would be a roguelike. I'm a very big fan
                of the genre and how it can provide many upon many hours of content through techniques like procedural
                generation. In the present, the only procedural generation in this game is the map through the use of
                cellular automata.

                helped me understand the use of automata to create cave-like maps. The cells that stayed alive after n
                generations represent the rocks and the dead cells represent empty space that can be navigated through
