            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p> This game was the final project for the course Modelation and Simulation of Natural Systems.
                Throughout the course I've learned many topics such as Physics Simulation, Particle Systems,
                Autonomous Agents, Cellular Automata and Fractals.
                The systems I ended up implementing into my game were: </p>

            <h2>Physics Simulation</h2>
            <h2>The Body</h2>
            <p> Before we can have physics in a game we need a way to represent our "things" or our "objects" like the
                player, enemy, etc, in the simulated physical world of our game.
                With that in mind I implemented a RigidBody that will represent all the entities that move in my game:
                the player, the enemy and even projectiles.
            </p>

                            <p>A rigid body means that it will not be possible to deform the body, in other words, the
                                distance between any points of a given body stays the same no matter what forces are
                                applied to it. However, the body can move throughout space when forces are applied to
                                it. In this game both friction and velocities are simulated by the rigidBody.
                                For this to be possible we need the following vectors: </p>
                            <ul class="custom-list">
                                <li>Position Vector with x and y coordinates to represent it's position in space</li>
                                <li>2d Velocity Vector</li>
                                <li>2d Acceleration Vector </li>
                                <li>A method to apply force to the body once</li>
                                <li>A method to simulate all forces applied to the body</li>

                    <p>Now that we have a way to represent our body in the virtual world we need a way to be able to,
                        move it move it, through it. In the next diagram you can see how the movement was planned out:

                    <h1> The RigidBody</h1>
                    <p> The RigidBody class has 3 types of movement that each children can use: </p>
                    <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li> <strong>Position </strong> - case Position where the Vector Position is directly acessed
                            and altered, equivalent to teleportation</li>
                        <li> <strong> Velocity</strong> - generic case where the body has velocity and acceleration</li>
                        <li> <strong> Force </strong> - where each instance of a RigidBody can override the main way of
                            moving</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> The following code represents the types of movement mentioned in the class RigidBody:</p>

                    <pre><code class="language-java">       public void move(float dt, ControlType ct, PApplet p) {
            switch (ct) {
                    case POSITION:
                        break; //not useful for this game
                                
                    case VELOCITY:
                        vel.add(acc.mult(dt));
                        pos.add(PVector.mult(vel, dt));
                        // acc.mult(0);
                        break;
                
                    case FORCE:
                        force(dt, p); // each child (extends) of RididBody will have different ways of moving
                        break; // player is different from enemy for example
                    }
                }

        protected abstract void force(float dt, PApplet p); 
                
                        </code></pre>
                    <br>
                    <h1> Movement Implementation</h1>
                    <p> The classes that will extend rigidBody will either use the Velocity type of
                        movement, like particle systems, and classes like the player will override the force method to
                        implement its own way of moving. You can see this in the following code, that is the
                        implementation of the stock and flow diagram:</p>

                    <pre><code class="language-java">     protected void force(float dt, PApplet p) {
            PVector frictionForce = PVector.mult(vel, -frictionCoeff);
            displayVectors(p, d, frictionForce, 255, 255, 255);
        
            vel.add(frictionForce);
            pos.add(PVector.mult(vel, dt));
            vel.add(PVector.mult(acc, dt));
    
            PVector newForce = PVector.mult(desiredDir(), speed * accelerationBoost);
            displayVectors(p, d, getDesiredDir(), 0, 255, 0);
    
            // Apply logarithmic acceleration decay based on current speed
            float speedFactor = 1.5f - PApplet.map(vel.mag(), 0, maxSpeed, 0, 1);
            newForce.mult(speedFactor);
    
            displayVectors(p, d, vel, 0, 0, 255);
    
            applyForce(newForce);
    
            vel.limit(maxSpeed);
            protected abstract void force(float dt, PApplet p); 
            }    
                                        </code></pre>
                    <br><br>
                    <p> The inspiration for the movement was source based games where when you press a desired key,
                        you'll have your movement incrementally added up until you reach the desired direction, instead
                        of
                        being instantaneous. The current velocity keeps being added a new force until it reaches the new
                        direction vector, which is calculated depending on the input of the player:</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="center-img">
                        <img display="center" src=../images/mssn/mod/player_force.png>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <p> The enemy for example is an Autonomous Agent, and it's movement will be similar to the player,
                        however the way the wished direction vector is calculated depends on the behaviour that the
                        agent is using. In this game the boid uses 2 behaviours - wander and seek, which will be
                        explained in greater detail in the Boid section. The following is the force function of the boid
                        class:</p>
                    <br>
                    <pre><code class = "language-java">
            @Override
            public void force(float dt, PApplet p) {
                PVector vd = applyBehaviours(dt, p).copy(); // this line is different
                
                PVector frictionForce = PVector.mult(vel, -frictionCoeff);
                
                vel.add(frictionForce);
                pos.add(PVector.mult(vel, dt));
                vel.add(PVector.mult(vd, dt)); //here the paramater vd is different, in player it uses ac
            
                float speedFactor = 1.5f - PApplet.map(vel.mag(), 0, maxSpeed, 0, 1);
                PVector newForce = PVector.mult(vd, speed * accelerationBoost);
                newForce.mult(speedFactor);
            
                applyForce(newForce);
                vel.limit(maxSpeed);
            }
            
     </code></pre>

                    <p> In retrospective, the common functionaly in the force method, between the player and enemy
                        classes, could be
                        refactored into it's own method in the rigidBody class. Only the directional vector is
                        calculated differently and
                        could've been passed as a parameter, to reduce repeated code with the same functionality </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1> Bullet </h1>
                    <p> The Bullet class also implements it's own force method, since once it's been shot I wanted the
                        bullet to move in a straight line, keeping the direction at the moment it was shot. The
                        following
                        code implements this:

                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-java">
            @Override
            protected void force(float dt, PApplet p) {
                pos.x += speed * dirx;
                pos.y += speed * diry;
        
            }</code></pre>

                    <h1> Particle System</h1>
                    <p> The particle System has the same movement as the player but the particles, use the
                        Velocity movement case of the rigidBody. And with that all entities that use the class RigidBody
                        have
                        it's movement implemented!</p>

            <h2>The Boid</h2>
            Boids are a form of autonomous agents that can be though of as a small robot that will respond directly to
            any stimuli its sensors give it without processing it.
            A boid can have many behaviours and through this course I implemented many but in my game I only ended up
            using two: <strong> Seek</strong> and <strong>Wander</strong>

            <h2>Development Challenges</h2>
            <p>The first problem was that I had to implement those systems from scratch which can be overwhelming. On
                top of that we were required to use the Processing library with java which is not a tool designed to
                make games. However despite this hurdles I sucessfuly implemented the before mentioned systems</p>

            <p>For each challenge, consider using this structure:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><strong>The problem:</strong> Clearly state what the challenge was</li>
                <li><strong>Your approach:</strong> Explain how you tackled the problem</li>
                <li><strong>The solution:</strong> Describe the working solution you implemented</li>
                <li><strong>Lessons learned:</strong> Share what you took away from the experience</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This section is particularly valuable to potential employers or collaborators as it shows your technical
                and creative thinking process.</p>

            <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project was useful to learn how physics can be implement in games. In particular it helped me have a
                better grasp around the implementation of a rigidBody which is common in many engines. It also helped me
                understand different systems like boids, cellular automata and particle Systems</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">

                <li>What you would do differently next time</li>
                <li>How this project influenced your approach to game development</li>
